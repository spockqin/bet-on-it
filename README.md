# ethereum-tasks
Task tracking website powered by smart contracts

A website that tracks your to-dos. 
You can push your tasks to the pool, a public task sharing space. This process will charge you some amount of ether but
you'll be able to get them back if you complete your task.

Other people can either bet against your completion of the task by downvoting you, which incurs a deposit of ether 
in the smart contract, or the other way.

The people who lost the bet will lost their deposits and people who betted for your completion of the task will win, 
generating a powerful motivation.

Future implementations include: implementing oracles as the event outcome judge, integerating Gnosis prediction market
APIs, and more security.
